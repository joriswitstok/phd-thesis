    I owe a great debt of thanks to the many people that have helped this thesis come to be. First and foremost, I should thank Renske and Roberto, a dynamic dream duo of supervisors. They have guided me not only through the many rewarding experiences of my PhD journey, but also past the inevitable obstacles I encountered along the way, notably including a global pandemic and a laptop meltdown in my final year. Scientifically, it has been a true privilege to have been mentored by two astronomers so exceptionally knowledgeable, inventive, and insightful. From a personal point of view, I am immensely glad to have been able to work with the supportive, generous, and kind people they are.
    
    These qualities seem to extend to all people, at least those that I have come across, who have spent time at the Institute of Astronomy (IoA). I am grateful to Jarle Brinchmann for his supervision during my time in Leiden, which was an important inspiration for me to continue pursuing astrophysics. During my master's degree at the IoA, I managed to acquire as many as three wonderful supervisors: my sincere thanks go out to Ewald, Girish, and Martin for their patience during my first steps to research and for their continued guidance and advice. I have been fortunate to meet many more incredible people that have become close friends: Clay, Pooneh, and Sam are among those I know since the very first day of the program. Moving into the Kavli, I was lucky to share the illustrious K35 office with Asia, Connor, Lester, Yucheng, Federica, Giulia, and others. Discussions with the talented PhD students, postdocs, staff, and many visitors at the Kavli and IoA have been hugely inspiring (something I became acutely aware of due to a distinct lack of discussion groups and coffee breaks during the pandemic closures). A special mention goes to Steve for his unwavering and indispensable assistance. Though it has been a pleasure to work with collaborators and colleagues beyond the Kavli, I am especially thankful for the insightful and stimulating feedback from Lewis, Mirko, Gareth, Nimisha, Nicolas, and recently Francesco, Tobias, and Sandro.
    
    I am grateful to the Kavli Institute for Cosmology, the Cavendish Laboratory, the IoA, and the University for accommodating these invaluable interactions that have ultimately shaped the research presented in this dissertation. I gratefully acknowledge financial support from the Fondation MERAC (Mobilising European Research in Astrophysics and Cosmology), European Research Council (ERC), and the Science and Technology Facilities Council (STFC). Furthermore, I am indebted to the support of all staff at the European Southern Observatory (ESO), National Radio Astronomy Observatory (NRAO), National Astronomical Observatory of Japan (NAOJ), European Space Agency (ESA), Space Telescope Science Institute (STScI), and National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA). Additionally, my gratitude goes out to the the developers of all software tools and packages used for this research, for which the relevant acknowledgements are listed at the end of each chapter. In particular, however, I am thankful to the developers of the \program{SciPy} library \citep{Jones2001}, its \program{NumPy} \citep{2011CSE....13b..22V} and \program{Matplotlib} \citep{Hunter2007} modules, the \program{Astropy} package \citep{2013A&A...558A..33A, 2018AJ....156..123A}, \program{ds9} \citep{2003ASPC..295..489J}, \program{topcat} \citep[Tool for OPerations on Catalogues And Tables;][]{2005ASPC..347...29T}, \program{qfitsview} (\url{https://www.mpe.mpg.de/~ott/QFitsView/}), and the \LaTeX\ typesetting system (\url{https://www.latex-project.org}).
    
    Outside of academia, I feel fortunate to have been immersed in Cambridge's kaleidoscopic community, starting at Sidney Sussex college. I have fond memories of Park Parade (though I do hope the heating is more reliable these days) with my close cycling companion and next-door neighbour Nic and the multi-faceted historians-turned-lawyers Brennan and Chris. The Park Parade ``PhD family'' went on to begin a new chapter on George Street, where Heather has tolerated my rowing and cycling chat the longest (until recently). Through the roll-out of Brexit, I was glad to keep up my Dutch with Jeanine and for entertainment we could always rely on adventurous stories from Kat. Reincarnations with Michael, Leonie, Amy, Bekah have built a legacy of bonfire dinners, indoor mini-golf, and TV shows of questionable quality (Theo, Ollie, Ben are off to a good start). SSBC: Tim, G{\"u}nther, and non-bowsiders. CUCC: Jacks, Toms, Matts, Jameses. Njord. GGH: Gerhard, Boyd, Anand, Coen, Sander, Jelger.
    
    Family: Paul and Marinke, Darwin. Papa, mama, Caro.
