\begin{declaration}

%    I hereby declare that except where specific reference is made to the work of 
%    others, the contents of this dissertation are original and have not been 
%    submitted in whole or in part for consideration for any other degree or 
%    qualification in this, or any other university. This dissertation is my own 
%    work and contains nothing which is the outcome of work done in collaboration 
%    with others, except as specified in the text and Acknowledgements. This 
%    dissertation contains fewer than 65,000 words including appendices, 
%    bibliography, footnotes, tables and equations and has fewer than 150 figures.

    I hereby declare that this thesis is my own work and contains nothing which is the outcome of work done in collaboration with others, except as declared in the preface and specified in the text. In particular, the following chapters are (partially) based on published articles resulting from research carried out in collaboration:
    \begin{enumerate}[label=(\roman*)]
        \item Part of \Cref{ch:Introduction} (specifically, \cref{chIssec:Effects_of_dust}) and all of \cref{ch:Dual_constraints_with_ALMA} are adapted from \citet{2022MNRAS.515.1751W}.
        \item \Cref{ch:Prospects_for_observing_the_low-density_cosmic_web_in_Lya_emission} is adapted from \citet{2021A&A...650A..98W}. This work is ultimately based on exploratory research undertaken in the research project of my master's degree, but its contents have been significantly altered and expanded during my PhD degree.
        \item \Cref{ch:Assessing_the_sources_of_reionisation} is adapted from \citet{2021MNRAS.508.1686W}.
    \end{enumerate}
    
    \noindent Co-authors that contributed to the relevant \cref{ch:Prospects_for_observing_the_low-density_cosmic_web_in_Lya_emission,ch:Assessing_the_sources_of_reionisation,ch:Dual_constraints_with_ALMA} are listed in full at the start of each respective chapter. I further declare that the contents of this dissertation are original and not substantially the same as any work that has already been submitted before for any degree or other qualification at this, or any other university, except as declared in the preface and specified in the text. This dissertation contains fewer than \num{60000} words including abstract, tables, footnotes and appendices, but excluding table of contents, photographs, diagrams, figure captions, list of figures, nomenclature, bibliography and acknowledgements.
